# This is my first big programming project. 
# It is made in Python 3.12 for my AP Computer Science Principles course, and thus must comply with CollegeBoard's rubric
# Outside help IS allowed, so long that I do not plagerize, so I am open to suggestions n' stuff. 
# Changes will probably need to be made, such as the music, to abide to CollegeBoard.
